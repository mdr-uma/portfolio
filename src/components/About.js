                        I’m a Web Developer and a Designer. Growing up in a small country like Nepal, where education for girls is rarely considered, I was fortunate to have a chance to pursue academics and learn basic computer knowledge during high school.<br/><br/>

                        I was excited, curious, and fascinated by everything I was learning. It was another world for me. I felt like I obtained the power to see other parts of the world, and I could connect with people globally. That's when I decided I want to learn more, but as stated earlier, it wasn’t easy for girls to step out and do what they wanted.<br/><br/>
                        
                        After facing many obstacles, I took a Graphic Design course and started working as a Graphic Designer while also learning how to code with my friend.

                        I chose different career paths, where I learned the fine art of customer service and teaching. But deep down, I always wanted to be in the technology field. I never gave up, which is why even after so many years, I joined Flatiron School - a coding Bootcamp - to fulfill my dream.<br/><br/>

                        No matter where I work, I always bring the same level of dedication, hard work, passion, and strong work ethic I have always had. As a multilingual person, I easily adapt to different environments and cultures. I am a big believer in continuous improvement, so I am always ready and willing to take on new challenges.<br/> <br/>

                        Besides coding I love to cook, dance, read books, and learn about new technologies.
